This repository contains a complete pipeline for document layout detection 
and multilingual OCR (Optical Character Recognition) using YOLO and Tesseract.
It is designed to process scanned documents in multiple Indian languages and extract structured text blocks.

Layout Visualization
Use the notebook Doclayout - Yolo_layout_reconstruction.ipynb to visualize YOLO predictions 
and overlay bounding boxes on the original document images.

Citation
Models are trained/fine-tuned on DocLayNet, a public dataset for document layout analysis.
